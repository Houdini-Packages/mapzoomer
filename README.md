## WARNING !
creating high resolution maps will take potentially a LOT of time and can result in a ban of your IP at google maps for 24 hours... (auto proxies will probably help download maps though, but anyway)

See example scene for example. But **BEWARE** for it will start downloading highres maps through proxies, that can take potentially up to 30 min

### TODO:
add less highres examples...
